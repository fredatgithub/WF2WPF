<div class="wikidoc"><b>Project Description</b><br />WF2WPF helps .NET developers learn WPF by converting their existing Windows Forms projects into WPF projects. WF2WPF is developed in C&#35;. It currently only supports C&#35; projects, but VB support is planned and in development.<br /><br />This project is intended to help developers learn how their Windows Forms knowledge can be translated into Windows Presentation Foundation. It does so by taking Windows Forms projects and performing a basic translation of the source code and project file into a corresponding WPF Project.<br /><br />With any utility like this, the obvious question is &quot;will this work for real-world code?&quot;. The answer to this question of course depends on the real-world code in question. There is almost an infinite number of ways to write .NET/Windows Forms code. Can this converter (or any converter) handle all of the possible Windows Forms applications that can be written? Absolutely not. <br /><br />What this converter does do is serve as an educational resource; it has a simple, easy to modify architecture that enables you to clearly see how you Windows Forms assets are being converted. We don&#39;t try to convert every asset, there are simply something things (even in a basic Windows Form application) that do not translate well into WPF.<br /><br />We took a best-guess on how to translate the basic assets in WF and WPF, but your feedback would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />WF2WPF is still a work in progress, so far, we can do the following:<br />
<ul><li>Basic Windows Forms controls</li>
<li>Carry over event handling code</li>
<li>Only C# projects (VB is coming soon!)</li>
<li>Datagrids support is coming soon!</li></ul>
<br />We&#39;ll keep posting more code as we get further along.<br /><br />Thanks!</div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
